# covid-share
## CEN3031 Final Project.

Our goal is to serve as both a formal and informal resource guide for COVID-19.
In this web application we will provide information and statistics about the disease, as well as provide a platform for those who have had the disease and want to inform others about their experience.

###### Instructions:
1) Clone repo
2) cd to server folder and run ```npm install``` to download all necessary dependencies
2) cd to client folder and run ```npm install``` , ```npm install google-map-react```, and ```npm install react-number-format``` to download all necessary dependencies

###### To run:
1) cd to server and run ```npm start```
2) cd to client folder and run ```npm start```

###### To commit:
It is recommended to pull before commiting to ensure that your local copy is in sync with the remote repository.
These are the steps I use (I don't know if they are 100% correct tho)
1)  ```git add *FILES*```
2)  ```git commit -m "commit message"```
3)  ```git pull```
4) ```git push origin master```
